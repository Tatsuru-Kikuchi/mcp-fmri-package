## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-fmri-package.git
cd mcp-fmri-package
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Development Dependencies
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Development Guidelines

### Ethical Code Requirements
All code contributions must:

1. **Emphasize Similarities**: Focus on detecting and highlighting similarities rather than differences
2. **Include Bias Detection**: Implement or enhance bias detection mechanisms
3. **Support Cultural Context**: Allow for cultural context integration
4. **Promote Individual Focus**: Emphasize individual variation over group patterns
5. **Maintain Transparency**: Include clear documentation and ethical considerations

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use Black for code formatting: `black src/`
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all public functions

### Testing Requirements
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Include ethical compliance tests
- Test bias detection functionality
- Verify cultural context integration

### Example Ethical Test
```python
def test_similarity_emphasis():
    """Test that analysis emphasizes similarities."""
    analyzer = GenderSimilarityAnalyzer(ethical_guidelines=True)
    result = analyzer.analyze_similarities(test_data)
    
    # Ensure similarity metrics are prominently featured
    assert 'overall_similarity_index' in result
    assert result['similarity_focus'] is True
    assert result['individual_to_group_ratio'] > 1
```
